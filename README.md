# The 10-Language Repo, the *decarepo*
On a quest to unlock a super trophy badge, `Rainbow Lang User`, as designed by [Ryota](https://github.com/ryo-ma) and detailed [here](https://github.com/ryo-ma/github-profile-trophy).

According to this [code](https://github.com/ryo-ma/github-profile-trophy/blob/master/src/trophy.ts) you need github to recognize 10 languages in your profile:

```
export class MultipleLangTrophy extends Trophy{
  constructor(score: number){
    const rankConditions = [
      new RankCondition(
        RANK.SECRET,
        "Rainbow Lang User",
        10,
      ),
    ];
    super(score, rankConditions);
    this.title = "MultiLanguage";
    this.filterTitles = ["MultipleLang", "MultiLanguage"];
    this.hidden = true;
  }
}
```
    
## Some languages
I will update this as I go
    
1. Python
1. Jupyter Notebooks
1. HTML
1. SQL - `data` type and so not counted
1. LaTeX
1. TypeScript
1. Julia
1. Go
1. C++
1. Rust
1. R
1. Java
   
> HTML and LaTeX are classified as `markup` languages; all others are `programming`    
    
## Not Languages
These are recognized by github but not counted towards the language statistics in your repo, as per Linguist.
    
1. Markdown; classified as a `prose` type, recognized with a `.md` extension
1. SQL; classified at a `data` type, recognized with a `.sql` extension
    
## Linguist
Github uses [Linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist/) to calculate language percentage inside a repo. It is based on file sizes and excludes generated files, binary, and non-program (vendor) files. The list of languages identified is [here](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml).
    
## What Languages?
Clicking on a language in the `Languages` tab will open a search result and detail all the languages that github has indexed in your repo. This is how I found that certain languages (TypeScript and C++) were being excluded.

A maximum of ten will be shown in the languages box (above), but you can verify others by changing the search string: https://github.com/millecodex/decarepo/search?l=typescript

Additionally you can check your top ten languages by including this [snippet](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) and replacing the username with your own:
