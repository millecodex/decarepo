	\question Think about the course title: Engineering Mathematics. In a few sentences answer the\\ following:
		\bp
		\part[1] What is mathematics?
			\bs Mathematics is a language used to communicate rules of logic.\es

		\part[1] What is engineering?
			\bs Engineering is the application of science to society. Science is studied using the framework of logic which is communicated through mathematics. A paper in engineering mathematics covers foundations in mathematics that can enable you to apply scientific knowledge to solve problems in society.\es

\question The distance an object falls when dropped from rest can be calculated using the formula:
\[\Delta x=\frac{1}{2}at^2\]
where $a=9.8$ ms$^{-2}$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $t$ is time in seconds.
\bp\part[4] Find stuff here.\ep

%%%%%%%%%%%% Q U E S T I O N %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

		\question \bp\part[4] Find the points of intersection of the two functions:
\[\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2+y^2=25\tag{1}\]
\[x^2-2y=8\tag{2}\]
		\bs
		From equation (2) isolate $x^2=8+2y$ and sub into equation (1):
		\begin{align*}
		\frac{x^2}{4}+y^2&=25\\
		\frac{8+2y}{4}+y^2&=25\\
		y^2+\frac{y}{2}-23&=0\\
		2y^2+y-46&=0
	\end{align*}
Use the quadratic formula to solve for $y$:
\begin{align*}
y&=\frac{-1\pm \sqrt{1^2-4(2)(-46)}}{2(2)}\\
y&=\frac{-1\pm \sqrt{369}}{4}\\
		y_1&=4.55 \mbox{ or }y_2=-5.05\\
		\end{align*}
		Sub $y$-values in to find the $x$-values:\\\medskip
		Using $y_1=4.55$, then $x_1=\sqrt{8+2(4.55)}=\pm4.13$\\
		Using $y_2=-5.05$, then $x_2=\sqrt{-2.1}$, which has no solution because the square root of negative numbers does not exist in $\mathbb{R}$.

		Therefore, the points of intersection are $(4.13,4.55)$, and $(-4.13,4.55)$.
		\es
		\part[4] Include a \Desmos plot with your submission. Show the points of intersection on the plot.

\bonusquestion[4] Use a graphics package such as \Desmos to plot your initials. Your plot must contain (at least):
\begin{itemize}
	\item two characters (any language)
	\item one curved section (e.g., circular, quadratic, sine, cosine etc.)
	\item one shaded region (e.g., $x<5$; $f(x)>\sin x$ etc.)
	\item a list of the functions plotted
\end{itemize}
Include a printout or screenshot of your design with your submission.
